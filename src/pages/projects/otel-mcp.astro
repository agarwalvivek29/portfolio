    problem="AI agents lack standardized access to observability data, making it difficult to build AI-driven monitoring and debugging workflows."
    solution="An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes OpenTelemetry observability data to AI agents, enabling them to query traces, metrics, and logs programmatically."
    technical="Python-based MCP server implementation following the Model Context Protocol specification. Integrates with OpenTelemetry collectors and backends to surface observability data through a standardized agent-friendly interface."
